                    contains the opponent's source code, and returns either 'cooperate' or 'defect'. You can use <a

                        template</a> as a starting point for your code. This is a question from open source game theory,
                    where open source refers to the fact that the opponent's source code is open, and game theory is the
                    study of interactions between agents, like the one you'll write. This problem is derived from a
                    classic problem in game theory - Prisoners' dilemma. For a more thorough description of the problem,
                    we encourage you to read the sections below.</p>
                <h2 dir="auto">The prisoner's dilemma</h2>
                <p dir="auto">There is a famous example in game theory, where two prisoners are arrested, and given two
                    options - stay silent, or betray the other prisoner. If both of them stay silent (i.e., cooperate
                    with each other), they get 1 year of prison time each. If either of them betrays the other (i.e.,
                    defects), the defector can go free, but the prisoner who stays silent gets 3 years. If both of them
                    betray each other, they get 2 years each.</p>
                <p dir="auto">Here's a table of the possible options and outcomes:</p>
                <div style="justify-content: center; align-content: center; display: flex">
                    <table>

                        <tr>
                            <th></th>
                            <th><strong>A cooperates</strong></th>
                            <th><strong>A defects</strong></th>
                        </tr>

                            <td>1 year prison time each</td>
                            <td>0 years for A, 3 for B</td>
                        </tr>

                            <td><strong>B defects</strong></td>
                            <td>3 years for A, 0 for B</td>

                    </table>
                </div>
                <p dir="auto">We can see that in any case except the one where both of them defect, one can get a better
                    outcome by defecting instead of cooperating. So, a rational individual will always defect, which
                    means at equilibrium (a point where no-one can take an action that can improve the situation for
                    themselves), both of them will get 2 years each in prison. <a href="https://youtu.be/UkXI-zPcDIM"

                <p dir="auto">Now consider the scenario where A and B are computer programs, and they can read the
                    other's source code. This is a classic example in open source game theory, which covers the cases

                            </li>

                                <p dir="auto"><code>proof_strategy(proof_strategy)</code> is a very interesting
                                    scenario. You might be tempted to say that this program will never halt, as both
                                    strategies will continue evaluating each other for infinitely many times (or, until
                                    a stack overflow). However, our strategy does not necessarily need to evaluate the
                                    opponent's strategy, just prove its cooperation. I encourage you to pause here and
                                    give this some thought. The correct solution follows:</p>
                                <p dir="auto">Suppose you could somehow look at the future. So, you decide to cooperate,
                                    and look at how the future plays out. Since you cooperated, the opponent cooperated
                                    as well. So, your decision to cooperate was correct. If you had decided to defect,
                                    your opponent would have defected as well. So, your decision would have been
                                    correct. Here, we can see that no matter what your decision is, the future pans out
                                    favorably to you. Therefore, we can prove opponent's cooperation conditioned on us
                                    cooperating, and thus we return <code>cooperate</code>.</p>
