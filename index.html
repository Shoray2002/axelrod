          <h2>
            The goal of this contest is to write a python function that takes in
            a string that contains the opponent's source code, and returns
            either 'cooperate' or 'defect'. You can use this template as a
            starting point for your code. This is a question from open source
            game theory, where open source refers to the fact that the
            opponent's source code is open, and game theory is the study of
            interactions between agents, like the one you'll write. This problem
            is derived from a classic problem in game theory - Prisoners'
            dilemma. For a more thorough description of the problem, we
            encourage you to read the sections below.
          </h2>
          <p>The Prisoner's Dilemma</p>

          <h2>
            There is a famous example in game theory, where two prisoners are
            arrested, and given two options - stay silent, or betray the other
            prisoner. If both of them stay silent (i.e., cooperate with each
            other), they get 1 year of prison time each. If either of them
            betrays the other (i.e., defects), the defector can go free, but the
            prisoner who stays silent gets 3 years. If both of them betray each
            other, they get 2 years each. <br /><br />
            Here's a table of the possible options and outcomes:

          <div class="images">
            <img src="./images/table.png" class="table" alt="table" />
          </div>
          <h2>
            We can see that in any case except the one where both of them
            defect, one can get a better outcome by defecting instead of
            cooperating. So, a rational individual will always defect, which
            means at equilibrium (a point where no-one can take an action that
            can improve the situation for themselves), both of them will get 2
            years each in prison.

          <p>Open source game theory</p>
          <h2>
            Now consider the scenario where A and B are computer programs, and
            they can read the other's source code. This is a classic example in
            open source game theory, which covers the cases when agents can look
            at their opponent's source code to figure out the best course of
            action.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here are a few strategies such agents can take in the original
            problem of prisoner's dilemma:
          </h2>
          <h2>
            1. Always Cooperate
            <br />
            <br />

            <code
              >def cooperate_strategy(opponent_source: str) -> str: return
              'cooperate'</code
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            This agent will always cooperate in all cases, which gives us a
            chance at achieving the optimal outcome.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            2. Always defect:
            <br />
            <br />

            <code
              >def defect_strategy(opponent_source: str) -> str: return
              'defect'</code
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            This agent will always defect in all cases, which represents the
            optimal strategy when you cannot see your opponent's source code.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            3. Choose a strategy randomly:
            <br />
            <br />

            <code
              >from random import random def random_strategy(opponent_source:
              str) -> str: if random() > 0.5: # or, any some threshold in place
              of 0.5 return 'cooperate' else: return 'defect'</code
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            This agent will defect or cooperate with equal probability.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            4. Cooperate if you are sure that the opponent is going to
            cooperate, defect otherwise: This is a very interesting case. You
            try to prove that the opponent is going to cooperate, and cooperate
            only if you can prove that the opponent will cooperate. The
            pseudocode here could look like:
            <br />
            <br />
            <code
              >def proof_strategy(opponent_source: str) -> str: #
              proof_will_cooperate isn't specified here, as this is one solution
              to this problem if proof_will_cooperate(opponent_source,
              self_source): return 'cooperate' else: return 'defect'</code
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            This agent will defect or cooperate with equal probability.
